# 1. About Product

GreenChase is a traceability tool for environment-friendly products developed based on blockchain technology. People can use this tool to trace whether the products they buy are environmentally friendly. It encourages users to be environmentally friendly by helping them trace and accumulate green credits, so as to improve the climate.

# 2. Core Innovations (spotlight)

For core innovations, let’s take the global recycled standard issued by textile exchange America as an example. This standard is used to certify the company has used recycled materials in their products. To make sure the whole supply chain has followed the rule, they use transaction certificates to monitor the whole supply chain. Which means for each trading, there will be a TC to show that it is the material certified by GRS. The whole supply chain will be like a tree map. We can seem **each TC as a new NFT collection** since it has an original **fixed number of the raw materials**. Using this nesting structure, we can trace every detailed information as we record them on chain. Through this, we can help customers to trace their supports & contributions to the environment, and to encourage more people to join in environmental protection.


# 3. What’s next

- Cooperate with different brands, project issuers and third-party testing and certification agencies
- Develop more different projects
- Look for financing opportunities 
- Develop more directions, such as food safety
- We hope to make the product become the supervisor and benchmark of the industry, to promote the trend of products through the power of users, to promote more brands to the path of sustainable development, and to let more people participate in environmental protection and sustainable development

# 6. About Team
We now just build a small team for the GR-14 hackathon. We have less than 10 people from more than 5 different regions/countries with different backgrounds. We hope to keep running our project after the hackathon and publish the tool in the next few months.
Together, we will build a great product and help make the earth a better greener place.
