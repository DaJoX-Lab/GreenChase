# 1. About Product

## 1.1 Introduction

This is a "trash " game, through "pick up garbage/ garbage classification/ garbage recycling" and other game processes to guide users to understand the knowledge of garbage classification and let people understand that garbage can also create new value, so as to promote the world environmental protection and sustainable development.

## 1.2 Background Story 

After humans have ravaged the earth for thousands of years, they have finally succeeded in "transforming" the earth into a barren land: nuclear pollution, plastic waste, electronic fog, dust smog ... All the pollution crises you can think of are in this land.
In this game you will play as a robot produced by the D.U.S.T -- dangerous union of science & technology, which were cast before the last humans left the earth, and in the vast years after humans left, you still faithfully perform your most core and most original work: resource recycling.

# 6. About Team
We now just build a small team for the GR-14 hackathon. We have less than 10 people from more than 5 different regions/countries with different backgrounds. We hope to keep running our project after the hackathon and publish the game in the next few months.
Together, we will build a great product and help make the earth a better greener place.
